# Recommender-System-COVID-19-Open-Research-Dataset-Challenge
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared a dataset of open sourced research papers. This data-set is a resource of over 45,000 scholarly articles, including over 33,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. 
</br></br>
The goal of this project is to use NLP and other machine learning algorithms to develop a recommendation system that can text-mine this database of research articles to gain useful insights about COVID-19. There are so many published papers that are COVID-19 related, to reduced the time for researcher to locate specific papers for them to read, the recommender system can give suggestion on what papers to read according to a specific query.
## Requirement
